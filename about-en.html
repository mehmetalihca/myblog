      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Mehmet Ali</strong>, a passionate student of <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Industrial Engineering</strong>. My journey in these two disciplines has allowed me to combine technical problem-solving with strategic thinking, giving me a unique edge in both software development and systems optimization.</p>

      <p>I was born in Hatay, and I have always been curious about how things work. That curiosity led me to engineering. At university, I discovered my love for building projects that are both functional and impactful—ranging from network programming tools to real-time web applications and data science experiments.</p>

      <p>Besides tech, I love writing, traveling, and sharing what I learn. This blog is my digital corner to tell stories from my academic journey, the projects I’ve built, and my Erasmus experience across Europe.</p>

      <p>Feel free to explore the rest of my site to learn more about the things I do and the places I've been.</p>
