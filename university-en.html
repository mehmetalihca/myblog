      <h2>My University Experience</h2>
      <p>Studying both <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Industrial Engineering</strong> has been a unique and challenging journey. Juggling double majors meant long nights, overlapping deadlines, and a steep learning curve — but it also shaped me into a versatile and resilient problem-solver.</p>

      <p>I’ve spent countless hours in the library, participated in student communities, and worked on multidisciplinary projects. I also contributed to a university podcast where I shared my experience as a double major student.</p>

      <p>This phase of my life taught me how to manage time, embrace challenges, and collaborate effectively. Every exam week was a new adventure, and every presentation a learning opportunity.</p>

      <p>Feel free to check out the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see what I’ve created during this time!</p>
